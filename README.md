SVG and .js asteroids clone

Written on a whim back in 2010. Just sharing for fun, not representative of my current coding abilities!

Download all files then and open the 'asteroids.svg' file in a modern browser.  Make sure it's being opened in the browser itself, and not by a plugin (try private browsing/incognito if not working).

Use arrow keys to move around, space to fire.
